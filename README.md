# StereoAlgorithm

#This code is only supported for mono and stereo audio files with the input samplerate

input  - > Path of input file

output - > Path of output file

This will improve the audio, especially in stereo and mono.
With the right audio mixer, the result will be optimised based on the gain adjustment.

High gain values may cause saturation, but this may not affect the code result; nonetheless, 
higher gain may cause audio to become corrupt.
